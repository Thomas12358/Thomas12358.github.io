I'm Thomas — an engineer at heart who bridges the worlds of chemical engineering and software development.
I started my career as a metallurgist, earned my PhD studying gas hydrates and fluid flow, and have lead software teams building tools used by energy companies around the globe.

Today, I work as a consultant based in Vancouver, Canada.

## My Background

My journey has taken me across disciplines and continents:

- **Started in mining** at BHP, developing predictive tools for ore processing
- **PhD in Chemical Engineering** split between The University of Western Australia and Colorado School of Mines, where I researched predicting hydrate blockages in gas pipelines
- **Moved into software** at Quorum Software, where I now lead a team building production forecasting software
- **Co-founded spatialview.io**, exploring new ways to visualize and analyze spatial data

## What I Do

I bring a unique perspective to software — combining deep engineering knowledge with practical development experience:

- **Lead engineering teams** building specialized software for the energy industry
- **Consult on technical challenges** where domain expertise meets software development
- **Develop scientific computing solutions** for process modeling and forecasting

## Beyond Work

When I'm not working, you can find me on the squash court — I serve as Secretary of the Evergreen Squash Club of West Vancouver. I've also been involved in the research community, having chaired the Gordon Research Seminar on Natural Gas Hydrate Systems.
